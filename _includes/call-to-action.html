                <p class="text-faded">Anamarijaâ€™s apartment is located in the heart of Split and is only a five minute walk to the busy streets and sights Split offers. We are two sisters that enjoy traveling so finding that right apartment is a big decision when it comes to planning. Having that in mind we have put a lot of effort into creating a relaxing and spacious apartment that will hopefully suit many preferences. Our apartment is in a high-rise building on the 5th floor. Yes, we do have an elevator! The apartment is equipped with a modern kitchen and appliances so that your morning coffee is always a click away.  We offer two bedrooms which can fit 3 persons per room. so, is my maths still serves me well that should add up to a six person apartment. We are suitable for families with young children as we offer a crib and a high chair.  </p>
